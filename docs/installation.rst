Some Tips
-----------

.. dropdown:: 1. Recommended Installation Environment
    :open:
        
    To simplify package management and ensure compatibility, we strongly recommend using the
    `Anaconda Distribution or Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html>`__ distribution. 
    Anaconda provides a well-managed Python environment, making it easier to install compatible versions of OpenSeesPy and its dependencies. After installation, users can set up a dedicated environment as follows:

    .. code-block:: bash

        conda create -n opensees python=3.12 numpy scipy pandas xarray notebook matplotlib
        conda activate opensees
        pip install openseespy
        pip install opstool
    
    From now on, you only need to work in this environment called ``opensees``, including installing packages, executing codes, etc.

.. dropdown:: 2. OpenSeesPy Version Compatibility
    :open:
        
    ``opstool`` does not impose a strict ``OpenSeesPy`` version requirement, but it utilizes some functionalities introduced in newer OpenSeesPy releases. 
    Therefore, **for Windows and Linux users, we recommend using the latest OpenSeesPy version to ensure full compatibility**.

.. dropdown:: 3. Python Version Dependency on Windows
    :open:

    *OpenSeesPy has a strong dependency on the Python version on Windows*, as it is compiled using specific Python headers. Users should ensure their Python version aligns with OpenSeesPy’s requirements to maintain compatibility. For instance, the latest OpenSeesPy 3.7.0 requires Python 3.12 on Windows.

.. dropdown:: 4. Python Version Requirement for opstool
    :open:

    Since opstool uses Python 3.10+ syntax features, installation requires **Python 3.10 or later** to ensure compatibility.

.. dropdown:: 5. Mac System Compatibility
    :open:
        
    The OpenSeesPy Mac version is independently maintained, and based on `PyPI records <https://pypi.org/project/openseespymac/>`_, it has not been updated for a long time. Since opstool does not explicitly specify an OpenSeesPy version, Mac users encountering installation issues may try **upgrading to Python 3.10+**. *However, OpenSeesPy versions on Mac may lack functionalities introduced in OpenSees 3.4.0 later, which could lead to some features being unavailable.*
