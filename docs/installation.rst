Some Tips
-----------

.. dropdown:: 1. Recommended Installation Environment
    :open:
        
    To simplify package management and ensure compatibility, we strongly recommend using the
    `Anaconda Distribution or Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html>`__ distribution. 
    Anaconda provides a well-managed Python environment, making it easier to install compatible versions of OpenSeesPy and its dependencies. After installation, users can set up a dedicated environment as follows:

    .. code-block:: bash

        conda create -n opensees python=3.12 numpy scipy pandas xarray notebook matplotlib
        conda activate opensees
        pip install openseespy
        pip install opstool
    
    From now on, you only need to work in this environment called ``opensees``, including installing packages, executing codes, etc.

.. dropdown:: 2. OpenSeesPy Version Compatibility
    :open:
        
    ``opstool`` does not impose a strict ``OpenSeesPy`` version requirement, but it utilizes some functionalities introduced in newer OpenSeesPy releases. 
    Therefore, **for Windows and Linux users, we recommend using the latest OpenSeesPy version to ensure full compatibility**.

.. dropdown:: 3. Python Version Dependency on Windows
    :open:

    *OpenSeesPy has a strong dependency on the Python version on Windows*, as it is compiled using specific Python headers. Users should ensure their Python version aligns with OpenSeesPyâ€™s requirements to maintain compatibility. For instance, the latest OpenSeesPy 3.7.0 requires Python 3.12 on Windows.

.. dropdown:: 4. Python Version Requirement for opstool
    :open:

    Since opstool uses Python 3.10+ syntax features, installation requires **Python 3.10 or later** to ensure compatibility.

.. dropdown:: 5. Mac System Compatibility
    :open:
        
    The OpenSeesPy Mac version is independently maintained, and based on `PyPI records <https://pypi.org/project/openseespymac/>`_, it has not been updated for a long time. Since opstool does not explicitly specify an OpenSeesPy version, Mac users encountering installation issues may try **upgrading to Python 3.10+**. *However, OpenSeesPy versions on Mac may lack functionalities introduced in OpenSees 3.4.0 later, which could lead to some features being unavailable.*
